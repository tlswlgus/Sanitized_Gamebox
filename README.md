## 🕹️ Features

### 🎯 Variety and Replayability

Every session selects three different mini-games without repeating any within the same set. This gives each playthrough a new rhythm.

Supports:

* Single-player (PvE)
* Local two-player mode (PvP)
* Shared-device play with no internet required

### 🤖 Smart and Simple Game Logic

Behind the scenes, Chippy’s GameBox uses lightweight but effective algorithms to improve gameplay.

Examples:

* Ping-Pong AI uses proportional movement with a touch of randomness to feel less robotic.
* Random selection system ensures three unique games each session through rejection sampling.
* Tic-Tac-Toe AI uses rule-based decisions to block, win, or choose strong positions.
